# Stuck in the Mud (Java Swing)

A Java Swing implementation of the classic dice game "Stuck in the Mud" 
designed to explore event-driven programming, GUI design, and state management.

## Overview
This project demonstrates building an interactive GUI game in Java. 
Players roll five dice, with dice showing 2 or 5 becoming “stuck,” 
while other values contribute to the score. The game ends when all dice are stuck.

The goal of the project was to practice **Java Swing**, **event-driven design**, 
and **managing game state** in a small interactive application.

## Technical Concepts
- Java Swing for GUI components and layouts
- Event-driven programming using ActionListeners
- Game state management and conditional logic
- Randomization and simple scoring mechanics

## How to Run
Compile and run with a single command:
```bash
javac *.java && java StuckInTheMud
